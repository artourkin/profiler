/**
 * This class is used to define a filter for a c3po data model class. It has a
 * list of filter conditions that should be applied on the data before executing
 * a query. This allows the drill down into the data.
 *
 * The persistence layer provider should interpret the conditions by logically
 * concatenating all conditions with an AND. If two or more filter conditions
 * apply to the same property, then they should be applied with a logical OR.
 * Consider the following example where we want to filter all objects from a
 * collection 'A' that have either text/html or text/xml mimetype. In such a
 * case the filter that will be passed to the will have
 * three {@link FilterCondition} objects: <br><br>
 *
 * first - property is 'collection' and value is 'A' <br>
 * second - property is 'mimetype' and value is 'text/html' <br>
 * third - property is 'mimetype' and value is 'text/xml' <br><br>
 *
 * Consider now that the same filter has to be applied but it has go over both
 * collection 'A' and collection 'B'. The caller has to include an additional
 * {@link FilterCondition} where the property is 'collection' and the value is
 * 'B' and the interpreter of this filter should use a logical OR for the
 * collection property as well.
 *
 * Additionally, if a condition of the filter has a null value for a given
 * field, then this has to be interpreted as: where any given value exists for
 * this property. For example, if a condition has a property 'mimetype' and a
 * value 'null', then the filter should interpret where the searched objects
 * have a mimetype field that exists.
